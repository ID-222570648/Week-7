    <div id="app">
        <component1></component1>
        <component2></component2>
        {{text}}
        </div>



    <p>Reflection: In this app the component 2 is local and component 1 is global. 
        Component 1 is available within component 2. 
        <br>Components can be registered as local or global. 
        When a component is registered as global, <br>
        It gets included with the build, so even if it is not in use,<br>
        the user will have to download it,<br>
        So lots of javascript gets downloaded. <br>
   In this case it is wise to declare it as JavaScript Object. <br>
   When a component is registered as global, components and it's subcomponents are available to each other.
   <br>
   Locally registered components and it's subcomponents are not available to each other.
